# (western science ) In The Beginning

Man conquered nature - this is proof that science existed

Deduction was the primary form of science.

Various claims on the foundation of the earth

- Thales, Milesian School ⇒ Water
- Anaximander, Milesian school ⇒ Anaximander theorized on the earth being cylindrical and claimed that the foundations were a combination of water earth, air and fire which he Termed **APERION**

- Heraclitus ⇒ (Fire)
- Democritus ⇒ (Atoms ) lived in abdera

Random Notes about these philosopher guys

Pythagoras was a numbers man he philosophized on the shape of the universe, good sound, and the adequate length of the string

Democritus was a "matter" man he was of the opinion that matter makes up nature, matter is made of small units (On this case he and Pythagoras seem to agree as Pythagoras says that specific things in the universe are finite.

# In the medieval times

The cradle of civilization was in Rome overpowered by the barbarians in 476 A.D

Philosophical Contributions were limited to Church Heads and Islamic heads 

There was excess food production without management

They believed in order to know

# In the Modern Times

Francis Bacon imposed induction as the adequate mode of knowledge acquisition

Thomas Hobbes adovcated for an even more mathematical approach for knowledge acquistion

Descartes argued that general principles are known by intuition while Newton and Gallileo argued that they were collected by experience 

Modern science is anchored on empricism and rationalism

## Life of Aristotle

> In Stagira he lived

After studying at the Platonic University starting at the age of 17 he founded his own university - **The Lyceum**

### Aristotle's concept of causality
